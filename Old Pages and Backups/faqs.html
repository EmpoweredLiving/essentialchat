                        <p>The AI gives helpful information, but it’s not perfect. Always double-check what it says to make sure it fits your needs. Think of the answers as a starting point, and feel free to adjust or personalize them to work best for you. </p><p>Also, sometimes it may repeat itself or pause before continuing. If that happens, you can click continue or rephrase your question to be more specific. If it doesn't give the answer you're looking for, try asking in a clearer or more direct way.</p>
